                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Vladimir Alvino Guerrero (born February 9, 1975) is a Dominican former professional baseball player who spent 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). A right fielder and designated hitter, he played for the Montreal Expos (1996–2003), Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (2004–2009), Texas Rangers (2010), and Baltimore Orioles (2011).</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A nine-time All Star, he was widely recognized as one of the best all-around players in the game because of his impressive offensive production, regularly hitting for power and average, and, prior to injuries that robbed him of range, stellar defense, and a strong throwing arm. He was also regarded as the game's premier "bad ball hitter," for his ability to consistently hit balls thrown well outside of his strike zone, a skill made evident on August 14, 2009, when Guerrero hit a pitch which bounced in front of home plate.</p>
                    <p>	On September 26, 2011, Guerrero became the all-time MLB leader in hits among players from the Dominican Republic, surpassing Julio Franco. He was later surpassed by Adrián Beltré in 2014. Through 2011, he was the leader among active major league outfielders in errors, with 125, and was second in assists, with 126.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Guerrero was a free agent for the first time after the 2003 season, and he signed a five year, $70 million deal with the Anaheim Angels after being courted by several teams. The owner of the Angels, Arte Moreno, was the first Hispanic controlling owner of a Major League ballclub, and Guerrero cited Moreno's heritage as a motivating factor for choosing the Angels over other teams.</p>
                    <p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During his first season with Angels, Guerrero led his club, and in some cases the American League (AL), in several offensive categories, including 124 runs (set new club record and led the AL), 13 outfield assists (Tied for 1st in AL), 366 total bases (tied club record and led AL), and a season ending batting average of .337 (3rd in AL). He was the second player in club history with .300/30/100 numbers. Among AL leaders, he finished in the top 10 of 20 major offensive categories, which led to Guerrero being voted the Gene Autry Trophy (Team MVP) by his teammates. Making his fifth MLB All-Star game appearance in July, he led AL outfielders with 3,024,870 votes and was the first Angel outfielder to be a starter since Reggie Jackson in 1984..</p>
