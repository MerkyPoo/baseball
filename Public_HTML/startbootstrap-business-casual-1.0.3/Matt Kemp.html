                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemp is the son of Carl Kemp and Judy Henderson, who never married. He was raised in Oklahoma by his mother, a registered nurse,
					and grandmother. When he was 13, his mother had another son, Tyler, who was born prematurely and died at age one.
					Kemp attended Midwest City High School in Oklahoma, where he was a standout in baseball.
					Kemp was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 6th round of the 2003 MLB Draft, and signed with the team on June 5,
					2003, for a $130,000 signing bonus.
                    
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemp was drafted by the Dodgers in the sixth round of the 2003 MLB Draft. After four seasons in the 
					minor leagues, he made his major league
					debut in 2006. He did not become a full-time player until 2008, when he took over as the starting center fielder for the 
					Dodgers. In 2011, Kemp led the National League in runs scored (115), total bases (353), OPS+ (171), WAR (7.8), home runs 
					(39), and runs batted in (126). Additionally, he became the first player to finish in the top two in both home runs and steals
					since Hank Aaron in 1963.

                    </h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 11, 2014, he was traded to the San Diego Padres along with Tim Federowicz and $32 million in cash for Joe Wieland, Yasmani Grandal, and Zach Eflin. The trade was not finalized until December 18 due to the Padres expressing some concerns over a physical which revealed Kemp had severe arthritis in both hips. The Padres attempted to renegotiate the deal after the physical but the Dodgers refused, and the deal was consummated as originally conceived.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemp played his first game with the Padres during opening day on April 6, 2015, against his old team, the Dodgers. During that game, Kemp drove in the only 3 runs for the Padres, as the team lost to the Dodgers 6-3.
					On August 14, 2015, against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, Kemp became the first player in the Padres' 7,444-game history to hit for the cycle. In the first inning, he hit a 2-run home run to center, followed by a single and a double. He finished with a triple to center field in the top of the 9th inning, scoring Yangervis Solarte from first. He finished the night 4-for-5.</p>
