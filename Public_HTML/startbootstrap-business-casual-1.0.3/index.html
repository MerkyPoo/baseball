                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ichiro approached the Mariners to ask for a trade at 
					midseason in 2012, as he felt guilty for taking a roster spot from a younger player while his
					team was in a rebuilding process. His first choice was to play for the New York Yankees.
					The Mariners traded him to the Yankees for minor league pitchers D. J. Mitchell and Danny 
					Farquhar on July 23. Seattle also received cash in the trade. Ichiro left Seattle hitting 
					.261 with a .288 on-base percentage (OBP), four home runs, 28 RBIs and 15 stolen bases in 95
					games. His first game as a Yankee was played the night of the trade, at Safeco Field against 
					the Mariners. Before the trade was consummated, Ichiro agreed to the Yankees' 
					conditions, which stated that they would play Ichiro primarily in left field, bat him at the
					bottom of the lineup, and occasionally sit him against left-handed pitching. Ichiro would
					go on to hit safely in his first 12 games as a Yankee, tying a record set by Don Slaught.
					Ichiro hit his first home run as a Yankee, and the 100th of his career, on July 30 against the Baltimore Orioles.
					For the week ending September 23, Ichiro was named AL Player of the Week after hitting .600 (15-for-25) with three 
					doubles, two home runs, five RBI, seven runs scored and six stolen bases in six games. He led all MLB players in batting 
					average, hits, steals and OBP (.630). In 67 games with New York, Ichiro batted .322 with a .340 OBP, 28 runs,
					five home runs and 27 RBIs. With his improved performance, the Yankees at times batted him second and also started him
					against left-handers.
					Ichiro performed well in his first playoff appearance since the beginning of his career. Against the Baltimore Orioles
					in the 2012 ALDS, Ichiro ran home on a ball hit by Robinson Cano. Despite the ball beating him to the plate, Orioles
					catcher Matt Wieters had difficulty tagging Ichiro, who evaded multiple tag attempts by jumping over and around Wieters.
					In Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Ichiro hit his first career postseason home run; however, the Yankees lost the series to 
					the Detroit Tigers in only 4 games.
					On December 19, 2012, Ichiro finalized a $13 million deal for two years with the Yankees
					.
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 25, 2013, Ichiro hit a walk-off home run against Rangers pitcher Tanner Scheppers with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. Earlier in the game, three of his teammates had led off the fourth, fifth and sixth innings with home runs, so all of the Yankees' runs in the game were provided by solo home runs.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 21, 2013, Ichiro collected his 4,000th professional career hit with a single off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher
					R.A. Dickey; becoming the seventh player in professional baseball history known to have reached the mark after Pete 
					Rose, Ty Cobb, Julio Franco, Hank Aaron, Jigger Statz, and Stan Musial. Jake Beckley and Sam Crawford may also have hit 
					4,000, but data for some of their minor league seasons is missing.</a>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July 10, 2014, Ichiro collected his 2,800th MLB hit off of Cleveland Indians pitcher 
					Scott Atchison in the top of the eighth inning at Progressive Field. On August 9, 2014, Ichiro 
					hit a single in a game, again against the Indians, to pass George Sisler on the all-time hit 
					list with his 2,811th hit.Ichiro had previously broken Sisler's single season hit record in 2004.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 23, 2015, Ichiro agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract with the Miami Marlins. The Marlins 
					originally planned for him to be their fourth outfielder, but he finished the season with 439 plate appearances 
					due to injuries, primarily to Giancarlo Stanton. On April 25, Ichiro scored his 1,310th major league run,
					which, combined with the 658 runs he scored in Japan, surpassed the record for runs scored by a Japanese player set 
					by Sadaharu Oh. On June 18, he was batting .294 after playing in 64 of the Marlins' 68 games, but his average fell
					to .229 by season's end.] On August 14 at Busch Stadium, Ichiro singled off St. Louis Cardinals starter John Lackey to
					earn his 4,192nd top-level hit, passing Ty Cobb. On July 29, Ichiro recorded his 2,900th major league hit against 
					Washington Nationals pitcher Doug Fister. On August 18, Ichiro had his first four-hit game since 2013. On August 31,
					against the Atlanta Braves, Ichiro scored his 2,000th professional run when combining his runs scored in MLB (1,342) and
					in Japan's NPB (658). On September 5, Ichiro recorded his 100th right field assist in the major leagues. On the final day
					of the season on October 4, he pitched one complete inning at the end of the game, allowing one run and two hits, in a game 
					the Marlins lost to the Philadelphia Phillies 7-2.
					Ichiro and the Marlins agreed on a one-year, $2 million contract for the 2016 season. The deal also comes with a $2 million club
					option for 2017.
