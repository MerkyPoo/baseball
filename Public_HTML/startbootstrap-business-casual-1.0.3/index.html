                    <p class="SE"> Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding.

The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running 
counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the
 bases and returns to home plate. Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters 
out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during 
teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records
 three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game comprises nine innings, and the
 team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Baseball is the only major team sport in America with no game clock, although 
 almost all games end in the ninth inning.

                    <p> Baseball is played between two teams with nine players in the field 
					on each team. On a baseball field, the game is under authority of several umpires. There are 
					usually four umpires in major league games; up to six (and as few as one) may officiate					
					depending on the league and the importance of the game. There are four bases. Numbered 
					counterclockwise, first, second and third bases are cushions (sometimes informally referred 
					to as bags) shaped as 15 in (38 cm) squares which are raised a short distance above the ground;
					together with home plate, the fourth "base," they form a square with sides of 90 ft (27.4 m) 
					called the diamond. Home base (usually called home plate) is a pentagonal rubber slab 17 in
					(43.2 cm) wide. The playing field is divided into three main sections:
					The infield, containing the four bases, is for general defensive purposes bounded by the 
					foul lines and within the grass line.
					The outfield is the grassed area beyond the infield grass line between the foul lines, 
					and bounded by a wall or fence.
					Foul territory is the entire area outside the foul lines.

                    <p> The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is
					difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 
					contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la 
					soule, with similarities to baseball. Other old French games such 
					as thèque, la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be 
					related. Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American 
					development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. 
					Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David 
					Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical 
					evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders and early baseball were
					actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents
					are the English games of stoolball and "tut-ball". It has long been believed that
					cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests 
					that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.

					The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, 
					A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description 
of "base-ball" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern 
game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead
 of ground-level bases. David Block discovered that the first recorded game of "Bass-Ball"
 took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player. William Bray,
 an English lawyer, recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey. 
 This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. Rounders was 
 also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry. The first known American
 reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing
 of the game near the town's new meeting house. By 1796, a version of the game was well-known enough 
 to earn a mention in a German scholar's book on popular pastimes. As described by Johann Gutsmuths, 
 "englische Base-ball" involved a contest between two teams, in which "the batter has three attempts to
 hit the ball while at the home plate." Only one out was required to retire a side.
Alexander Cartwright, father of modern baseball
By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early 
forms of baseball being played around North America. These games were often referred to locally as "town ball",
 though other names such as "round-ball" and "base-ball" were also used. Among the earliest examples to 
 receive a detailed description—albeit five decades after the fact, in a letter from an attendee to Sporting Life
 magazine—took place in Beachville, Ontario, in 1838. There were many similarities to modern baseball, and some
 crucial differences: five bases (or byes); first bye just 18 feet (5.5 m) from the home bye; batter out if a hit 
 ball was caught after the first bounce. The once widely accepted story that Abner Doubleday invented baseball
 in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports historians.
In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, led the codification of 
the so-called Knickerbocker Rules. The practice, common to bat-and-ball games of the day, of "soaking" 
or "plugging"—effecting a putout by hitting a runner with a thrown ball—was barred. The rules thus facilitated 
the use of a smaller, harder ball than had been common. Several other rules also brought the Knickerbockers' game
 close to the modern one, though a ball caught on the first bounce was, again, an out and only underhand pitching
 was allowed. While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest now 
 recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken
 , New Jersey: the "New York Nine" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings. With the Knickerbocker 
 code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century.
