                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Torii Kedar Hunter (born July 18, 1975) is an American former professional baseball center fielder and right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Detroit Tigers from 1997 through 2015. Hunter was a five-time All-Star, won nine consecutive Gold Glove Awards as a center fielder and was a two-time Silver Slugger Award winner.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born and raised in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Hunter attended Pine Bluff High School. Hunter, along with his three brothers, were raised in poverty and lived in a rough neighborhood, but were able to find sports as an outlet. Hunter began playing baseball at the age of eight and also began playing football from a young age, excelling as both a quarterback and free safety. At Pine Bluff High, Hunter excelled in baseball, football, basketball, and track. Early on in high school, Hunter was actually a stand out in sports other than baseball, but would receive All-State honors for his junior and senior seasons. According to the head coach of the team, Hunter once hit a ball 550 feet for a home run. In 1992, Hunter made the U.S. Junior Olympic team, and when he struggled to pay the $500 fee for the team, Hunter wrote then-governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, a letter asking for help, which Clinton accepted. Hunter had the option of attended Pepperdine University to play baseball, but opted to play professional baseball instead.</p>
                    <p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning down a three-year, $45 million deal in August 2007 from the Twins,
					Hunter signed a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim worth $90 million. He replaced Gary Matthews Jr. as the everyday center fielder. Hunter hit three home runs in one game against the San Diego Padres on June 13, 2009. It was the first time in his career he had accomplished the feat. Hunter was selected to represent Los Angeles in the 2009 All-Star Game, making his third appearance, but he was unable to participate. He was on the disabled list because he had crashed into the outfield wall at Dodger Stadium and at AT&T Park, separating his right shoulder. This sidelined him for more than a month.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 14, 2012, it was announced that Hunter and the Detroit Tigers had reached a two-year agreement worth $26 million. He would be playing right field and batting second for most of the season. After Hunter signed with the Tigers, pitcher Rick Porcello let him have #48, which Hunter has worn for his entire career, and Porcello changed his uniform to #21.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 2, 2014, Hunter agreed to a one-year deal worth $10.5 million with the Minnesota Twins, with whom he had previously played from 1997 to 2007. The deal became official on December 3, 2014. On October 26, 2015, Hunter announced his retirement from baseball.</p>
