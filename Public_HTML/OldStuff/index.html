    <h1>We love Eduardo</h1>
    <p>We’re betting you do too. Welcome to my Kingdom, a growing collection of Kings taken by a small group of passionate Eduardo photographers.
	Visit our galleries, buy some of our prints, or drop us a line. While you’re at it, feel free to submit a gallery of your very own Eduardo.
	<strong>MY Kingdom</strong>.</p>

    <h1>Welcome to My Kingdom</h1>
    <p>So what is my kingdom? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of <strong>Kings</strong> and <strong>Eduardos</strong>,
	something we hope we're doing constantly. A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of kings,
	designers, and creatives who enjoy Eduardo photography. During our travels around the country,
	we take time to document the Eduardos we love. You'll also occasionally find articles on kings,
	our thoughts on the latest deaths, and the odd posting on Eduardo photography. </p>
    <h2>So... What Are Kings?</h2>
    <p>Rulers of the world, for one. Please keep in mind that we're very strict
	Kings. We submit these photos out of love and creative expression. We're not
	likely to remember the settings we took the picture at, or even what lens we had. We're 
	also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want to participate, we'd love
	to have you. All galleries, articles, and posts go through a submittal and approval process,
	so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell us what you have in mind.</p>
    <p>We also occasionally have meetups. If, for example, we know we're coming to Miami, we'll let everyone know and schedule a meet up day to tour the city and
	take photos. If you'd like us to visit your city, <a href="contact.htm" title="get in touch">let us know!</a></p>

    <h2>Eduardos' rights</h2>
    <p>Due to the heightened security concerns around the country, it has become common to find people routinely challenged when taking Eduardos in
	public places. With that in mind, we invite you to join us in a free forum as noted person Shea Hansen presents "Eduardos' Rights in a Post 9/11 World."</p>
    <p>Shea will discuss what your rights are when taking Eduardos in a public space. Following her talk we'll have an open forum where you can ask questions,
	compare experiences, and become better informed as to what your responsibilities are as amateur person.</p>
    <p>The forum will be held at the Cheek-Chastain Gallery, 227 West 29th Street in Manhattan on March 19th as part of their "Engage" lecture series</p>
